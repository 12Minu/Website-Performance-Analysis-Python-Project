Project Title: Website Performance Analysis Using Python

Brief One-Line Summary:
  A data analysis project that examines website traffic, user engagement, and channel performance using Python-based exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques. 

Overview:
  This project focuses on analyzing real-world website data to understand user behavior, engagement trends, and traffic sources.
  It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to generate meaningful insights that can help improve website performance and decision-making. 

Problem Statement:
  Organizations often struggle to understand:
      1. How website sessions and users change over time
      2. Which marketing channels drive the most traffic
      3. Which channels create higher engagement and better user interaction
      4. How engagement varies by time of day and traffic source...
           This project aims to answer these questions through structured data analysis and visualization. 
  
Dataset:
 The dataset contains website analytics metrics such as:
   1) Channel group
   2) Date and hour of visit
   3) Users and sessions
   4) Engaged sessions
   5) Average engagement time per session
   6) Engagement rate and events...
        After cleaning, the dataset includes 3182 records with validated numeric and datetime fields for analysis. 


Tools and Technologies:
     1.Python
     2.Pandas
     3. NumPy
     4. Matplotlib
     5. Seaborn
     6. Jupyter Notebook...
         These tools were used for preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization. 


Methods:
  1. Data loading and validation
  2. Data cleaning and type conversion
  3. Feature extraction (hour from datetime)
  4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  5. Visualization of traffic, engagement, and channel behavior
  6. Trend and correlation analysis between sessions and engagement...
        All preprocessing and visualization steps were performed using Python data science libraries. 


Key Insights:
  1. Website sessions and users show time-based trends.
  2. Certain marketing channels contribute significantly higher user traffic.
  3. Engagement time and engagement rate vary across channels.
  4. Some channels generate more engaged sessions than others.
  5. Traffic intensity changes depending on the hour of the day.
  6. Engagement rate and sessions show observable relationships over time...
        These insights help optimize marketing strategy and improve website performance. 


Visuals Output:
      The project generates multiple visual outputs:
   1. Sessions vs. users over time line chart
   2. Total users by channel bar chart
   3. Average engagement time by channel
   4. Engagement rate distribution boxplot
   5. Engaged vs. non-engaged sessions comparison
   6. Hour-wise traffic heatmap by channel
   7. Engagement rate vs. sessions trend line...
        These visualizations support data-driven decision-making. 


How to Run This Project?
     Install Python and required libraries:
     1. pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
     2. Open Jupyter Notebook.
     3. Load the dataset CSV file.
     4. Run the preprocessing, analysis, and visualization cells step-by-step...
        This will reproduce all insights and charts from the project. 


Results & Conclusion:
   The analysis successfully identifies:
   1. High-performing traffic channels
   2. User engagement behavior patterns
   3. Time-based traffic variations
   4. Relationships between engagement and sessions...
   These findings can guide marketing optimization and improve website user experience. 


Future Work:
1. Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI or Tableau)
2. Apply machine learning for traffic prediction
3. Perform deeper cohort and retention analysis
4. Integrate real-time analytics pipeline
